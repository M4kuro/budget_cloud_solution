# Inventory Monitoring System

## üöß Project Status: **In Development**

### Current state:

#### **A simple demo is ready and set for alerting users on changes made on the table, as well as the summary weekly report**

---

### **Overview**

This project provides an **automated inventory monitoring system** using only free tier AWS services.  
It tracks stock levels in **real-time** and generates **weekly summary reports**.

---

## **üìå Features**

‚úÖ **Real-time stock tracking** (DynamoDB Streams + Lambda)  
‚úÖ **Low stock alerts** (SNS Notifications)  
‚úÖ **Weekly reports saved to S3**  
‚úÖ **Automated report generation via EventBridge**

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è AWS Services Used**

- **DynamoDB** ‚Üí Inventory storage
- **Lambda** ‚Üí Processes stock updates & generates reports
- **SNS** ‚Üí Sends alerts & notifications
- **S3** ‚Üí Stores weekly reports
- **EventBridge** ‚Üí Schedules weekly report generation

---

## **üöÄ How It Works**

### **üîπ Real-Time Inventory Updates**

1. **DynamoDB Streams trigger Lambda** when stock updates.
2. Lambda **checks for important changes**, such as a product name or price change and **sends SNS alerts if needed.**
3.

### **üîπ Weekly Summary Reports**

1. **EventBridge triggers Lambda** every Thursday at 5 PM UTC.
2. The report is saved in **S3** and an **SNS notification** is sent.

## Data Design

This project utilizes DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service, for data storage. The data design is optimized for scalability and performance, reflecting DynamoDB's key-value and document-based structure.

### Entities and Relationships

- **Product:**
  - product_id (Primary Key)
  - product_name
  - product_category
  - stock_count
  - last_alert_time
- **Sales:**
  - sale_id (Primary Key)
  - product_id (used to associate with product)
  - sale_date
  - quantity
  - price
- **Alerts:**
  - alert_id (Primary Key)
  - product_id (used to associate with product)
  - alert_time
  - alert_type
- **Reports:**

  - report_id (Primary Key)
  - report_date
  - report_type
  - report_location (e.g., S3 URI)

  - Relationships are managed using product_id to associate sales and alerts with products.
  - Sales data is linked to products via the `product_id` attribute.
  - Alerts are also linked to products using `product_id`.
  - Reports are stored in S3, with the location referenced in the `report_location` attribute.

### DynamoDB Details

- The `product_id` serves as the primary key for the Product entity.
- Sales data uses `sale_id` as the primary key and includes `product_id` for association with product information.

For detailed information on each attribute, please refer to the [Data Dictionary](link-to-your-data-dictionary).
